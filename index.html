  Friendship is one of the most important relationships we have in life. <br>
  A true friend is someone you can rely on when you’re happy, sad, or facing challenges. <br>
  They are the people you can talk to without fear of being judged. Friends listen, understand, and support you, even when things aren’t going well. 
  They accept you for who you are, including your flaws, and encourage you to be the best version of yourself. When life feels overwhelming, having a friend by your side makes everything seem a little easier. <br>

  A good friend won’t always agree with you, but they will always have your back. <br>
  Whether you’re laughing together or helping each other through hard times, friends remind us how important it is to connect with others. <br> They show us the value of loyalty, kindness, and being there for one another. 
  In a world that can sometimes feel lonely, friendships remind us that we’re not alone. 
  They give us strength and happiness, making life more meaningful and enjoyable.
